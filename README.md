# Eloquent JavaScript Practice

This repository documents my progress as I work through *Eloquent JavaScript* by Marijn Haverbeke (3rd edition). I'm starting with **Chapter 2**, where the book introduces program structure in JavaScript.

## Why This Repo Exists

I'm using this space to:
- Practice writing JavaScript code by hand
- Reflect on what I'm learning
- Keep track of working solutions to exercises and experiments
- Build a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced JavaScript and React Native projects

## Scope & Approach

- Each chapter has its own folder
- Exercises and experiments will be written as `.js` files
- Some chapters may include notes or comments alongside the code
- I'm skipping Chapter 1 because it's conceptual and has no exercises

## Chapters Covered

- [x] Chapter 2 – Program Structure
- [ ] Chapter 3 – Functions
- [ ] Chapter 4 – Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
- [ ] Chapter 5 – Higher-order Functions
- [ ] Chapter 6 – The Secret Life of Objects
- [ ] Chapter 7 – Project: A Robot
- [ ] Chapter 8 – Bugs and Errors
- [ ] Chapter 9 – Regular Expressions
- [ ] Chapter 10 – Modules
- [ ] Chapter 11 – Asynchronous Programming
- [ ] Chapter 12 – Project: A Programming Language

## How to Run the Code

All examples are written in plain JavaScript and are runnable with Node.js.

To run a specific file:

```bash
node 02 - Program Structure/Chessboard.js
```

## Notes
This project is part of my larger effort to become a software developer, with a focus on educational and creative apps. You can follow my progress here as I build both my skills and my confidence in JavaScript.
