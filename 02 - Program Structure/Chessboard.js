/* Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using 
newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is 
either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 
and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the 
given width and height. */

for (let line = 1; line <= bindingSize; line++) { //line counter
    let i = ""; //Initialize the string.
    for (let square = 1; square <= bindingSize; square++) { //square counter
