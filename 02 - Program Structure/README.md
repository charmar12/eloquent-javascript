# 02 - Program Structure

This folder contains my practice code for the "02 - Program Structure" section of [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

## Files

- `Chessboard.js`
- `Fizzbuzz.js`
- `Looping_a_triangle.js`

## Notes

I've decided to backtrack a little and make sure I'm solid on the fundamentals by using a new book. So far so good.
